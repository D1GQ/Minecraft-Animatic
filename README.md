## Getting Started

### Rigs To Use
1. **Rigs From Me:**
I'm not fully sure how many rigs I'm going to make for this add-on but you can check what I've made so far from this [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1sqq_dfsfyfIOlT5TmKUKU6mJGF4AzElv). Every rig that I make are going to be supported for blender 2.8+

### For glTF Models

1. **Create Animation:**
   After animating the original imported model, select all related objects.

2. **Export Animation:**
   Go to `File > Export > Export Minecraft Animation`.

3. **Finish:**
   The animation is now exported and ready for use in Minecraft.

### For Properly Rigged Models

1. **Baked Rig:**
   After making an animation if the rig is properly set up there should be a separate Armature part of the rig for baking the animation.

2. **Bake Action:**
   In pose mode on the Baked Rig, go to `Pose > Animation > Bake Action`. Ensure "Clear Constraints" is ticked and "Clear Parent" is unticked.

3. **Export Animation:**
   While the Armature is selected go to `File > Export > Export Minecraft Animation`.

4. **Finish:**
   The rigged model's animation is exported, enhancing the Minecraft experience.
